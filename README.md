✅ Conditional Access as Code with Terraform and GitHub Actions
This project demonstrates how to implement Conditional Access Policies as Code using:

Terraform

Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Entra)

GitHub Actions for CI/CD

The goal is to automate the deployment of Conditional Access policies in a secure, repeatable, and auditable way using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

🚀 Use Case: Block Non-Compliant Devices from Untrusted Locations
This use case creates a Conditional Access policy that:

Applies to all users, excluding guests and external users.

Applies when sign-in risk is medium or high.

Blocks access from devices not compliant with organizational policy.

Excludes access from trusted locations.

Requires Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

Includes session control configurations.

🔧 Tech Stack
Tool	Purpose
Terraform	IaC for Azure resources
AzureAD Provider	Provision Conditional Access policies
GitHub Actions	Automate the CI/CD workflow

📁 Project Structure

🔐Prerequisites
Azure AD App Registration with the following:

API permissions: Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess

A client secret (store the value, not the ID)

Assign Required Directory Role:

At least Security Administrator or Conditional Access Administrator

Create GitHub Secrets:

Secret Name	Description
ARM_CLIENT_ID	App (client) ID
ARM_CLIENT_SECRET	Client secret value (not ID!)
ARM_TENANT_ID	Tenant (directory) ID

⚙️ How It Works
GitHub Actions triggers on:

Push to main

Manual workflow_dispatch

Terraform authenticates using secrets from GitHub

A Conditional Access Policy is created or updated based on main.tf

🧪 Testing the Setup
Push a change to main

Or manually trigger from GitHub Actions → "Deploy Conditional Access Policy"

Check Azure Portal → Azure AD → Security → Conditional Access → Policies
